This class (EEEN 40010, taken at University College Dublin in the fall of 2024) discusses several techniques (root locus, bode plots) to design various controllers, such as PID, lead/lag, and linear state feedback controllers. Design constaints such as settling time and percent overshoot are heavily considered, and digital controllers are also discussed.
